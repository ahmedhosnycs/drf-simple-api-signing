Contribution
=============

We encourage developers to contribute, so please feel free to fix bugs, improve things, provide documentation.

Contribution steps are simple:

1. Create an issue and explain your feature/bugfix.
2. This indeed should initiate the discussion about it.
3. Once it is approved, it will be labeled with `accepted`.
4. Fork the repo and make sure that all unit tests are working on your development environment.
5. Create a branch from `develop`.
6. Before submitting a Pull Request, make sure to rebase with the latest thing on ``develop``.
7. Collaborators will review, then you have to address their comments in your PR.
